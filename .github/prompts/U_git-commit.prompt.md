# Git Commit

Commit changes to the repository.

## Goal

Group changes into logical commits.

Create commits with clear messages that describe the changes made to the codebase following conventional commit guidelines.

Keep commits linked to features, tasks, or issues when applicable.

## Context

- [Conventional Commits standards](../instructions/std_conventional-commits.instructions.md)

## Workflow

- [ ] Use the #changes tool to track changes in the repository.
- [ ] Group changes into logical commits.
- [ ] Read the [Backlog](/docs/BACKLOG.md), if it exists, for linking the changes to specific features or issues.
- [ ] Commit following the Conventional Commits standard

## Validation

- [ ] Use the #runCommands tool to ensure git status is clean by running `git status`

> End of the git commit prompt.
