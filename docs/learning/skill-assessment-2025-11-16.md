## Strengths

- **Design Patterns Mastery**: Exceptional knowledge of design patterns and best practices (8/10) -
  you know how to structure good code
- **Quality-Focused Thinking**: Strong ability to anticipate problems and think about non-functional
  requirements like performance, security, and scalability (both 8/10)
- **Debugging Excellence**: Strong debugging skills (8/10) with ability to track down issues
  effectively
- **Testing Practice**: Regularly writes tests (7/10) and understands testing importance
- **Refactoring Comfort**: Excellent at handling and cleaning up messy code (8/10)
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Despite being new to current stack, successfully transferring pattern
  knowledge from previous experience

---

## Growth Opportunities

- **System-Level Architecture**: Strengthen ability to see how individual features fit into the
  overall system (currently 5/10) - a natural next step given your strong pattern knowledge
- **Domain Expertise**: Continue building deeper knowledge of current tech stack (currently 4/10,
  but progressing well)
- **Upfront Planning**: Increase time spent on code structure planning before implementation
  (currently 6/10)
- **Advanced Debugging Tools**: Deepen familiarity with advanced debugging features beyond basics

---

## Learning Goals

Ambitious and comprehensive growth focus across multiple areas:

- Writing cleaner code
- Understanding architecture better
- Getting faster at debugging
- Learning testing properly
- Building confidence in decisions

This broad focus demonstrates strong commitment to holistic skill development.

---

## Coaching Preferences

**Explanation Style**: Brief and practical-first **Guidance Approach**: Questions to check
understanding, direct advice when needed **Theory Balance**: Focus on practical application, with
theory when it supports the work **Pacing**: Efficient and direct

---

## Recommended Coaching Adaptations

Based on this assessment, Morgan will:

- **Keep it Practical**: Provide brief, focused explanations with practical examples first
- **Architecture Focus**: Dedicate significant attention to system-level thinking and how pieces fit
  together
- **Pattern Transfer**: Help you apply your strong design pattern knowledge to the current tech
  stack
- **Confidence Building**: Use guided questions to strengthen decision-making skills
- **Balanced Theory**: Introduce just-enough theory to support practical understanding
- **Quality Emphasis**: Leverage your existing strength in quality thinking to deepen architectural
  skills
- **Progressive Challenge**: Start with practical implementation, gradually increase architectural
  complexity

---

## Next Steps

Recommended workflows to start with:

1. **Guided Story Implementation** (\*guided-story) - Practice step-by-step development with
   architectural guidance
2. **Architecture Session** (\*architecture-session) - Strengthen system-level thinking before
   coding
3. **Learning Plan Creation** (\*learning-plan) - Create structured roadmap for your comprehensive
   learning goals

## Reassessment

This assessment can be updated anytime by running:

```text
*assess-level
```

Consider reassessing:

- After completing a major learning goal
- When switching to a new tech stack
- Every 3-6 months to track growth
