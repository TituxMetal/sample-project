# Architecture Session Workflow - TODO

## Workflow Purpose

Collaborative architecture design before coding - teaching architectural thinking.

## Workflow Type

Interactive - Highly collaborative, intent-based

## Key Components Needed

### workflow.yaml

- Config source: bme/config.yaml
- Template: false (interactive workflow)
- Instructions path
- Output: Architecture decision document to learning_output_path

### instructions.md

Steps needed:

1. Understand the problem/feature to architect
2. Guide thinking about:
   - System boundaries
   - Data flow
   - Component responsibilities
   - Integration points
3. Explore trade-offs between approaches
4. Ask questions that reveal concerns:
   - Scalability needs
   - Maintainability
   - Testing strategy
   - Future extensibility
5. Collaboratively document decisions
6. Create visual diagrams (mermaid)
7. Identify risks and mitigation strategies
8. Define success criteria

## Notes

- Teaches HOW to think architecturally
- Uses Socratic questioning
- Explores multiple options before deciding
- Documents rationale for decisions
