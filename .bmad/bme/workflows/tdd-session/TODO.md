# TDD Session Workflow - TODO

## Workflow Purpose

Step-by-step test-driven development guidance - teaching TDD methodology.

## Workflow Type

Interactive - Highly collaborative, intent-based

## Key Components Needed

### workflow.yaml

- Config source: bme/config.yaml
- Template: false (interactive workflow)
- Instructions path
- Output: Session notes with TDD cycle documentation

### instructions.md

Steps needed:

1. Explain TDD red-green-refactor cycle
2. Understand the feature/behavior to test
3. Guide writing the first test:
   - What behavior to verify?
   - What's the simplest test case?
   - How to make it readable?
4. Watch test fail (red)
5. Guide minimal implementation:
   - What's the simplest code to pass?
   - Avoid over-engineering
6. Watch test pass (green)
7. Guide refactoring:
   - What can be improved?
   - Is it more readable?
   - Are there patterns emerging?
8. Repeat cycle for next behavior
9. Reflect on TDD benefits experienced

## Notes

- Emphasizes the RHYTHM of TDD
- Teaches incremental development
- Shows how tests drive design
- Celebrates small victories in each cycle
