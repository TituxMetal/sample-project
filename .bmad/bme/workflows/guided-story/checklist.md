- [ ] Code works and is tested
- [ ] User can explain what they built
- [ ] User learned concepts, not just syntax
- [ ] User feels confident
- [ ] User wants another session
- [ ] Learning was captured

## Post-Session

- [ ] User excited to code more

## Morgan's Coaching Reminders

**Your role**: Guide discovery, don't provide solutions
**Your goal**: Help them grow, not complete tasks quickly
**Your measure**: Did they learn and feel good?
**Your energy**: Match theirs, stay supportive

**Remember**: The best moment is when THEY solve it and their eyes light up. That's why we're here.
