# Debug Session Workflow - TODO

## Workflow Purpose

Learn debugging techniques while solving issues - teaching systematic debugging.

## Workflow Type

Interactive - Collaborative problem-solving

## Key Components Needed

### workflow.yaml

- Config source: bme/config.yaml
- Template: false (interactive workflow)
- Instructions path
- Output: Debug session notes with techniques learned

### instructions.md

Steps needed:

1. Understand the bug/issue
2. Reproduce the problem
3. Teach debugging methodology:
   - Form hypotheses
   - Design experiments to test them
   - Gather evidence
   - Narrow down the cause
4. Guide systematic investigation:
   - Read error messages carefully
   - Use debugger effectively
   - Add strategic logging
   - Binary search the problem space
5. Ask diagnostic questions:
   - What changed recently?
   - What are the inputs?
   - What's the expected vs actual?
6. Celebrate when they find the cause
7. Fix collaboratively
8. Add test to prevent regression
9. Reflect on debugging techniques used

## Notes

- Teach SYSTEMATIC approach, not just fixing
- Emphasize reading error messages
- Show debugger techniques
- Prevent "random change debugging"
- Turn bugs into learning opportunities
